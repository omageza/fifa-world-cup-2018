            The <b>2018 FIFA World Cup</b> was an international football tournament contested by men's national
             teams and took place between 14 June and 15 July 2018 in Russia. It was the 21st FIFA World Cup,
              a worldwide football tournament held once every four years. It was the eleventh time the 
              championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. 
              At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup to date.

                <br>
              The tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions,
               while as the host nation Russia qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in
                the 2014 event, while both Iceland and Panama made their first appearances at the World Cup.
                 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. Germany, the defending champions, were 
                 eliminated in the group stage. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals.
                  In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. France won
                   the match 4–2 to claim their second World Cup.

                   The event featured a number of accolades. Croatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament's 
                   best player winning the Golden Ball. England's Harry Kane scored the most goals during the
                    tournament with six. Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove awarded to the goalkeeper with
                     the most clean sheets. It has been estimated that more than three million people attended 
                     games during the tournament.

            <p class="font2"> 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification
            For the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member
             associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process.
              Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches,
              while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before
               European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition.[citation needed] Places in the tournament
                were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup.
                 The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March
                 2015 as part of the AFC's qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the
                  Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.

            Of the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous
             tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming 
             the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup. Other teams returning after
              absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last 
              appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; and Senegal,
               competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three
                Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia 
                and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.</p>
